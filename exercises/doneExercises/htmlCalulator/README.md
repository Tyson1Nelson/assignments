HTML SIMPLE CALCULATOR
==============================

Here the exercise goal was to:

Have one section (<div>) for each math operation (so 3 sections) total
Each section has two inputs to take the first and second numbers
Each section will have a button to perform the operation
inject the result into the HTML (not an alert)
The website will have 3 colors
The website will have proper padding/spacing to lay things out nicely
