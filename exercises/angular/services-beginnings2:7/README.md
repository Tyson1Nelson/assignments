SERVICE BEGINNINGS (angular)
====================================

In this exercise we had to have a service.js file and link it to our controller js fill. 
The goal of this exercise was to be able to input a pokemon name and have it added to the html page as normal text. Then be able to delete that post or text by retyping the name and hitting a remove button.
